Recall that in the previous assignment, we introduced the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and its consequence that the distributions of sample statistics approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases. The amazing thing about this is that it applies to the sampling distributions of statistics that have been calculated from even highly non-normal distributions of data! Recall, also, that hypothesis testing is very much based on making inferences about such sample statistics. You're going to rely heavily on the CLT to apply frequentist (parametric) tests to answer the questions in this notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import
